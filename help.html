                    'Use By' indicates that the food is unsafe to eat after the date specified. This is put on for health and safety reasons. 
                    You should never eat food past its 'Use By' date.
                </p><p>
                    'Best Before' indicates the time when the food is at its freshest, but the food won't necessarily be unsafe after this date. 
                    You should still take care before eating food past its 'Best Before' date, as it may still be unsafe.

                    To have an item added to the shopping list automatically when it gets too low:
                </p><ol>
                    <li>Go to the <a href="/database/food.html">fridge</a> page</li>
                    <li>Enter the details of the item you want to be added automatically</li>
                    <li>
                        In the field labelled 'Add to shopping list automatically when below:', 
                        enter an amount.
                    </li>
                </ol><p>
                    Once the item in the fridge drops below this amount, an item with the same amount which was selected initially will be added to the shopping list automatically. 
                    The item from the shopping list, if added back to the fridge, will also be added back to the shopping list automatically.
                </p><p>
                    If you want to have an item already in the fridge be added to the shopping list automatically, you can enter the value into the 'Add automatically below:' field in edit mode.
                    You must also enter a value into the field labelled 'Amount to add:' to select how much you want to be added to the shopping list.
                </p><p>
                    To disable adding food to the shopping list automatically, simply set the 'Add automatically below:' field to zero.
